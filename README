Using images of the aurora taken from the ISS, find location of the aurora over the Earth.

This is done using the following method:

1. Segment (using k-means) to get the ground, sky, and aurora.
2. Filter resulting images to only get the brightest stars, generate star-trail images from these.
3. Extract the length and direction of the star trails.
4. Use the length of the star-trails (star velocity) to find the direction the camera on the ISS is pointing.
5. Find where on the earth the aurora is above, using inverse projections to find the distance to the aurora, and project this back onto a map.

Running the code:

The main.m is the starting point for running the code.  The following steps need to be taken to run the code:

1. Change the constants at the top of the main.m file to reflect the data set to process (see comments in main.m).
2. Download a full resolution data set from: http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/Videos/CrewEarthObservationsVideos/Videos_Aurora.htm   The example data set is: "North Dakota to Central Quebec*", the first 60 frames starting with: ISS030-E-53334.JPG
3. Run each part of the main file seperatly to see the process, or run the entire file to generate all the graphs and data. 

Requirements and extra libraries:

* Requires MATLAB and the mapping and image processing tool boxes. 
* Requires the M_MAP library: http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~rich/private/

Notes:

Two different segmentation methods were tried:
* kmeans
* level sets (jeff orchard)

kmeans seemed to work better (took less time and still gave us what we needed).

The reverse projection code in step 5 makes a lot of assumptions that result in low quality results, this area of the code need to be improved to use less assumptions and approximations.

The segmentation does not work for all data sets, if it doesn't work on the data set you want to process, try changing the constants in the kmeans part of the code.
